# Section 8, Exercise 11: Fun with Spelling and Guessing Words

# Define a word that contains seven different letters, or is a collection of 
#   seven different letters.
# Ask the user to enter a string, and if it is an empty string, exit.  If the 
#   string contains only letters from the seven defined letters, congratulate  
#   them.  If not, then say something else.
# I interpreted the requirements as the user string had to contain all of the
#   letters in our list, but Reuven meant just what I said above, that their
#   word contains only our letters, but not necessarily all of them.
# A sample successful word is "perjure" â€” it uses only letters from our list.
# Retried in this version after seeing the approved solution.
